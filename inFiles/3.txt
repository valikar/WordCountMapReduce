The first computer-based speech-synthesis systems originated in the late 1950s. Noriko Umeda et al. developed the first general English text-to-speech system in 1968 at the Electrotechnical Laboratory, Japan.[10] In 1961 physicist John Larry Kelly, Jr and his colleague Louis Gerstman[11] used an IBM 704 computer to synthesize speech, an event among the most prominent in the history of Bell Labs.[citation needed] Kelly's voice recorder synthesizer (vocoder) recreated the song "Daisy Bell", with musical accompaniment from Max Mathews. Coincidentally, Arthur C. Clarke was visiting his friend and colleague John Pierce at the Bell Labs Murray Hill facility. Clarke was so impressed by the demonstration that he used it in the climactic scene of his screenplay for his novel 2001: A Space Odyssey,[12] where the HAL 9000 computer sings the same song as astronaut Dave Bowman puts it to sleep.[13] Despite the success of purely electronic speech synthesis, research into mechanical speech-synthesizers continues.[14]

Handheld electronics featuring speech synthesis began emerging in the 1970s. One of the first was the Telesensory Systems Inc. (TSI) Speech+ portable calculator for the blind in 1976.[15][16] Other devices had primarily educational purposes, such as the Speak & Spell toy produced by Texas Instruments in 1978.[17] Fidelity released a speaking version of its electronic chess computer in 1979.[18] The first video game to feature speech synthesis was the 1980 shoot 'em up arcade game, Stratovox (known in Japan as Speak & Rescue), from Sun Electronics.[19] The first personal computer game with speech synthesis was Manbiki Shoujo (Shoplifting Girl), released in 1980 for the PET 2001, for which the game's developer, Hiroshi Suzuki, developed a "zero cross" programming technique to produce a synthesized speech waveform.[20] Another early example, the arcade version of Berzerk, also dates from 1980. The Milton Bradley Company produced the first multi-player electronic game using voice synthesis, Milton, in the same year.
